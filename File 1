            <strong>Chris's Cover Letter:</strong> <br>
            He recently started working on web development utilizing HTML5, CSS3/SASS, and JavaScript. He currently have a bachelor’s in management, but he recently found a passion for code. His passion came from the fact that coding and bringing creativity will actually make a difference for a company. He plans to volunteer his skills for those who need it. He is starting slow and working on mastering each programming language instead of learning them all at once. He has roughly a year and a half left before receiving my bachelor’s in computer science. I plan to utilize my skills as a software engineer. I am currently learning Python, C++, Laravel frameworks, React, NodeJS, PHP, Java/Rest API. I want to make a career change at this point in my life and want to start at a company that has a great reputation and #1 B2B startup by LinkedIn. <br>
